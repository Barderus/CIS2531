Description:
The bank offers the following types of accounts to its customers: 
    * savings accounts
    * checking accounts
    * money market accounts. 
    
Customers are allowed to:
    * deposit money into an account (thereby increasing its balance)
    * withdraw money from an account (thereby decreasing its balance)
    * earn interest on the account
    
Each account has an interest rate. Assume that you are writing a program that will calculate the amount of interest 
earned for a bank account.
