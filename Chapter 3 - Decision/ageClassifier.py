Description: Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age. 
The program should display a message indicating whether the person is an infant, 
a child, a teenager, or an adult. Following are the guidelines:
If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
                
If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
                
If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
                
If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.
