'''
Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence 
that describes himself or herself. Here is an example of the programâ€™s screen:
    Enter your name: Julie Taylor 
    Describe yourself: I am a computer science major, a member of the 
Jazz club, and I hope to work as a mobile app developer after I graduate. 

Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file, 
containing the input, for a simple Web page.
